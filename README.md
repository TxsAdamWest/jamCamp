Project Description:

Music was my first love before I thought to code. I played in a metal band with my brother since highschool and lots of practice went into making sure our songs were tight and show performance was on point. One of the biggest problems however was just getting 5 guys in a room at the same time and place. Jam Sesh is a tool to help bands organize and set practice dates and shows. As a leader, you can set practice dates and times while gaining the notification when your band mates see and approve it. As a member, you can quickly see when the next practice or show is and send your leader confirmation that you'll be there. Built for mobile devices and desktop view, its quick, responsive, and intuitive design will let band mates know who will make it, and who's down for a Jam Sesh.

Dashpage - contains static demo data
Schedule View - Able to create event posts that will link to members of a band, can invite members to a band via their username email.
